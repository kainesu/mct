Hi! I'm a synthetic biologist from Singapore, currently working on engineering bacteria to use more sustainable feedstocks. I recently graduated from a university in the UK and will be heading to the US soon to start on my PhD. I am interested in how synthetic biology can be used to solve issues in sustainability.
