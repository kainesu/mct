    "text": "Figure out your research interests\nAt the start of my search, I found it useful to distill what exactly my research interests are. This will also help you write your SOP later on.\n\nCan you describe your research interests in one sentence?\nWhat are some key words you would use to describe your research interests?\n\nFor example, in my case, I was broadly interested in creating synthetic biology tools and applying them solve issues in sustainability, so I looked into labs with related goals. I tried to be as open-minded as possible and also long-listed labs that were vaguely related work even if it wasn’t directly related to my research interests."

    "text": "Searching for labs\nOnce I had defined my research goals, these were the things I did to find labs:\n\nAsk experienced scientists in the field for lab recommendations (I just asked my PI)\nEnter my research interests into Google\nLook into the institutions of authors who wrote papers that I liked\nIf I found a lab that I liked, I would look into all the programmes that lab was associated with and check the descriptions of all the other labs in that programme\n\nDuring my search, I noticed that the labs I was interested in working with were actually scattered across different programmes and departments. For example, in my case, synthetic biology labs were typically found across biology, chemistry, biological engineering, chemical engineering, and microbiology programmes. So have a look at the schools’ list of PhD programmes to get a full list of what programmes they offer. Often, a professor may be associated with multiple programmes in a school, which gives you the flexibility to apply to the programme which your profile matches the best with.\nTo keep track of all the information during the search process, I made a spreadsheet that listed the labs I was interested in, along with a short description of their research, and a link to the lab website."

    "section": "Narrowing down the field",
    "text": "Narrowing down the field\nAfter I made my long list, I narrowed down the list of programmes to just 9, and also identified 3 labs in each programme that I could write about in my statement of purpose (more later on). To decide which programmes to apply to, I used the following criteria:\n\nNumber of professors in the programme whose research I was interested in: I only wanted to apply to programmes where there were at least 3 professors whom I could see myself working with. I decided on 3 because that is the typical number of rotations you get in a PhD programme. I reasoned that the more labs I was interested in, the more likely the programme was a good fit for my research interests.\nLab diversity: Particularly, I looked for diversity in the membership of the lab. Is there a good mix of PhD students to postdocs? A mix of American and international students? A mix of people of different genders, ethnicities, ages? In my past experience, I felt that diverse labs had more welcoming and inclusive environments. There were actually a few labs whose research I was interested in, but decided against applying to because their membership was too homogenous.\nCity environment: Since a PhD will take 5-7 years to complete, I wanted to do it in a city I’d be comfortable living in. So things like cost of living, weather, activities, food, etc. came into consideration.\n\nSome other factors you might want to consider, but I didn’t really prioritize, were: lab size, school environment, school ranking, how famous the professor is… In my opinion, school ranking (e.g. QS) is irrelevant to the quality of the programme because it’s too subfield-dependent."

I wrote something like this:\n\nDear Prof XXX,\nI hope you and the lab are well! I have recently started my new job as a…\nI am currently applying to PhD programmes, and I was wondering if you would be willing to write a strong letter of recommendation on my behalf. I had a fruitful time working on my thesis project in your lab, and I was hoping that you could speak to my ability and interest in research. \nI am mainly looking at various bioengineering programmes in the US and UK, as I am particularly interested in studying the application of synthetic biology to sustainability issues. \nPlease let me know if you would be willing and, if so, if there is anything else you might need from me. I have attached a copy of my CV for your reference, and I would also be happy to draft a letter if that would be helpful.\nThank you!\nBest regards,"

However, if this happens, do not panic! If the rest of your application is complete apart from the LOR, programmes will not typically reject your application right away - there is an understanding that PIs are busy and may not meet the deadline. Just email the programme right away to let them know about the situation, and email your recommender to remind them about the deadline. This situation happened to me with one of my recommenders and it turned out fine.\nOnce everything has been submitted, definitely send a thank you email to your recommenders, and update them on how your application turned out."
