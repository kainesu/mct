This will also help you write your SOP later on.\n\nCan you describe your research interests in one sentence?\nWhat are some key words you would use to describe your research interests?\n\nFor example, in my case, I was broadly interested in creating synthetic biology tools and applying them solve issues in sustainability, so I looked into labs with related goals. I tried to be as open-minded as possible and also long-listed labs that were vaguely related work even if it wasn’t directly related to my research interests."

For example, in my case, synthetic biology labs were typically found across biology, chemistry, biological engineering, chemical engineering, and microbiology programmes. So have a look at the schools’ list of PhD programmes to get a full list of what programmes they offer. Often, a professor may be associated with multiple programmes in a school, which gives you the flexibility to apply to the programme which your profile matches the best with.\nTo keep track of all the information during the search process, I made a spreadsheet that listed the labs I was interested in, along with a short description of their research, and a link to the lab website."

    "text": "Narrowing down the field\nAfter I made my long list, I narrowed down the list of programmes to just 9, and also identified 3 labs in each programme that I could write about in my statement of purpose (more later on). To decide which programmes to apply to, I used the following criteria:\n\nNumber of professors in the programme whose research I was interested in: I only wanted to apply to programmes where there were at least 3 professors whom I could see myself working with. I decided on 3 because that is the typical number of rotations you get in a PhD programme. I reasoned that the more labs I was interested in, the more likely the programme was a good fit for my research interests.\nLab diversity: Particularly, I looked for diversity in the membership of the lab. Is there a good mix of PhD students to postdocs? A mix of American and international students? A mix of people of different genders, ethnicities, ages? In my past experience, I felt that diverse labs had more welcoming and inclusive environments. There were actually a few labs whose research I was interested in, but decided against applying to because their membership was too homogenous.\nCity environment: Since a PhD will take 5-7 years to complete, I wanted to do it in a city I’d be comfortable living in. So things like cost of living, weather, activities, food, etc. came into consideration.\n\nSome other factors you might want to consider, but I didn’t really prioritize, were: lab size, school environment, school ranking, how famous the professor is… In my opinion, school ranking (e.g. QS) is irrelevant to the quality of the programme because it’s too subfield-dependent."

    "text": "If you’re an international student heading to the US for graduate school, you’ll probably need an F1 or J1 visa (depending on what your international office has told you). Here I talk about my experience of getting an F1 visa at the US embassy in Singapore as a Singaporean citizen.\n\nTimeline\nMy visa application timeline looked like this:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDate\nEvent\n\n\n\n\n~29 Apr\nApply for new passport*\n\n\n3 May\nPassport ready for collection*\n\n\n10 May\nCollect new passport at post office*\n\n\n10 May\nApply for I-20 form\n\n\n23 May\nReceive I-20 form electronically from MIT international students’ office\n\n\n24 May\nComplete application for F1 visa (DS-160 application form)\n\n\n24 May\nPaid for I-901/SEVIS fee and MRV fee\n\n\n27 May\nApplied for a visa interview appointment and granting of interview waiver\n\n\n28 May\nDropped off documents at Aramex courier office\n\n\n5 Jun\nVisa issued\n\n\n6 Jun\nPicked up passport (with visa) from Aramex courier office\n\n\n\n*Optional steps\nTotal time: 39 calendar days\nHow long it takes for you will depend on when in the year you apply - wait times for visa interview appointments tend to get really long (~1 month) approaching Jun-Aug, when lots of people are starting school in the US. So it’s really important you start applying as early as possible to get your visa in time for the start of school!\nYou can also refer to the official US Travel Docs website for primary info about the process.\n\n\nTotal cost of application\n\n\n\nDescription\nCost (SGD)\n\n\n\n\nPassport renewal\n70\n\n\nI-901/SEVIS fee\n480\n\n\nMRV fee\n259\n\n\nTotal\n809\n\n\n\n\n\nApplying for a new passport\nMy previous passport was going to expire in 2025, so I decided to apply for a new passport to avoid having to apply for one while in the US. Since I was now applying as an adult, my new passport has a 10-year validity period (rather than a 5-year one), which would comfortably encompass the duration of my PhD studies. I’d recommend doing this to save yourself some inconvenience in the long-term.\nApplying for a new passport as a Singaporean in Singapore is easy - just go to the ICA website and fill in the necessary details. ICA was really efficient and they had my new passport ready within a week, so I made an appointment to collect my passport at a nearby post office - the earliest I could make my appointment was a week later.\nIf you do need your passport earlier, though, you can take your chances at going to the Passport Unit at the ICA Building directly with your NRIC and old passport. Usually you have to book an appointment to collect at the ICA building, which is not an option offered to everyone who applies for a new passport, so this is not guaranteed to work. However I do know one person who tried this way and they got their passport right away.\nI did have to take a new passport photo, but I took it at home using a smartphone and a passport photo application. If possible, have your photo also fulfill US visa photo requirements so you can reuse the same photo.\n\n\nApply for I-20 form\nThe I-20 form is a “Certificate of Eligibility” that is issued by your school as evidence that you are attending the school. You need it to apply for an F1 visa.\nThe process probably differs between schools - at MIT, the International Students’ Office has a web portal for international students to submit their information and request an I-20. Their website said they take 10-15 business days to issue the I-20, and I indeed received mine after 10 business days. Your school does need your passport information to issue an I-20, so if you’re applying for a new passport, you’ll need to wait for that first before you get your I-20.\n\n\nComplete application for F1 visa (DS-160)\nThe application form for the F1 visa is called a DS-160, which you can access here. It is also one of the most tedious forms I’ve ever had to fill! Otherwise, it is fairly straightforward to complete. Just fill it in honestly and accurately as possible, and double check your responses before submitting!\n\n\nPay for I-90/SEVIS fee\nAfter you complete your application, you’ll need to pay for the I-90 SEVIS fee, which is on a different website. This step is also pretty straightforward. You should then print out the receipt for your visa application (see below).\n\n\nApply for a visa interview appointment (and getting an interview waiver)\nFor Singaporeans, you once again have to visit a different website to schedule your visa interview. This portal will tell you when is the next closest time you can schedule your interview, and it actually differs from the US Department of State’s online appointment wait time tracker. For example, at the point in time when I was scheduling my interview, the State Department’s website said the wait time was 17 calendar days, but the US Travel Docs’ portal said the next appointment was 20 calendar days away. So I would log into the the US Travel Docs portal to get the latest info rather than use the State Department tracker, although it does give a good estimate.\nWhen you apply for the visa interview, you will need to pay US Travel Docs a machine-readable visa (MRV) fee, presumably to cover the cost of producing your visa and the interview. This fee must be paid before you are allowed to schedule an interview. However, they only process the MRV fee during business hours, so if you pay for it on a weekend, you need to wait until 3pm of the next business day for it to be processed (and thus become able to schedule your interview). For example, I actually paid for the MRV fee on 24 May (Fri) evening, but could only schedule my interview on 27 May (Mon) afternoon.\nIn the end I was actually fortunate to receive a waiver for the visa interview, i.e. I did not have to attend an interview. This is because, as of 1 Jan 2024, the US has a new policy where applicants who meet the following criteria do not have to attend an in-person interview:\n\n\nWere previously issued a nonimmigrant visa in any classification, unless the only prior issued visa was a B visa (emphasis mine);\nAre applying within 48 months of their most recent nonimmigrant visa’s expiration date;\nApply in their country of nationality or residence;\nHave never been refused a visa (unless such refusal was overcome or waived);\nHave no apparent or potential ineligibility\n\n\nIn my case, I actually had received a J1 visa about 2 years ago because I had previously been to the US for an exchange programme, which made me eligible for the visa interview waiver. This waiver was granted through the US Travel Docs portal - you have to answer a series of questions which determine whether you can receive a waiver.\nImportantly, the US embassy may still call you in for an in-person interview if they deem it necessary, though this did not happen for me.\n\n\nDropping off the documents at the Aramex courier office\nAfter I was granted an interview waiver, I was given instructions to drop off some documents at an Aramex courier office at Bstone Travel, which is a travel agency located in People’s Park Centre. Note that the office is only open during business hours until 5.30pm. At this stage, be careful to check you are submitting all the required documents, because they may call you in for an interview if you are lacking some documents.\nThe documents that I submitted were:\n\nDS-160 confirmation page (i.e. the page with a barcode you receive after submitting the DS-160)\nMy current passport\nMy previous passport (as proof of my J1 visa)\nDrop-box submission letter (this is the same as the Interview Waiver Confirmation Letter)\nColour photograph\nProof of SEVIS payment\nCopy of valid I-20 (you can print the electronic version from your school, then sign on the printed copy)\nProof of financial statements (I submitted a letter from my school as well as my scholarship agency saying that I was being covered by a scholarship)\nMy CV\n\nWhen you get to Bstone Travel, there is a counter with a sign indicating US visa drop off, and you can simply pass your documents to the employee at the counter. There is no fee you have to pay at drop off. The employee will issue you a receipt with a tracking number for your documents, and that’s it. You can then enter this tracking number on the Aramex website to see when your documents have been delivered to the US embassy - I believe mine were delivered 1-2 days after I dropped them off.\n\n\nVisa processing and issuance\nAfter you drop off your visa documents, there is actually a State Department website that lets you track the progress of your visa application, but in my experience the status of my visa wasn’t updated at all on this website so it was useless.\nMy visa took about 1 week to be issued after I dropped off my documents at Aramex, which was a lot faster than I expected. I received an email and a text message from Aramex saying that my passport was ready for collection. Additionally, when I checked the State Department visa tracker, it was now updated to say that my visa had been issued.\nFrom friends who did have to do an interview, their visas were also issued within a week of the interview, so the turnover time does seem to be quite short.\nThere might be a case where you need to travel overseas (e.g. you had booked a vacation some time ago), but your passport is still with the embassy. I actually had a concern about this happening to me as I had a trip planned in July, though fortunately my visa was issued in time. If this issue does happen to you, the US Travel Docs website says you can contact their helpline to request a temporary return of your passport.\n\n\nPicking up your passport\nMy passport could be picked up from courier office at Bstone Travel. Note that Aramex stipulates that you need to pick up your passport within 15 business days of getting the notice of it being ready. I actually asked my mom to help me pick up my passport as I was busy at work the entire week – I probably could have picked it up on my own the next week, but I was pretty anxious to get my passport back.\nIf you want to ask someone else to pick up your passport on your behalf (only a spouse, parent, or child), they will need to bring along:\n\nTheir own IC\nA copy of your IC\nA printed/written hardcopy letter of authorization (as proof that you gave the person permission to collect your passport)\n\nI also gave my mom the Interview Waiver Confirmation Letter and the drop off receipt just in case the staff asked for it.\nFor the letter of authorization, I just followed some templates that Aramex had posted online:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEnding notes\nAnd that’s it! The entire application process was surprisingly efficient, although I suspect this was because I was privileged to be a Singaporean citizen and also had a previous US visa. Your best resource is really going to be your school’s international student office, so do reach out to them if you face any hiccups in your visa application process."
