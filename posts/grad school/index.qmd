Some months ago I finished the process of applying to graduate school in the US. I thought to write about what my experience so that future grad school applicants can get an updated view of what it's like.

# Context 

My field is synthetic biology, so this information will probably be most relevant to applicants in the biological sciences.

# When should I start applying? 

Most of the grad schools I applied to had deadlines in early December, though I know there are many biology PhD programmes that have deadlines in November. Given this fact, I would start looking for programmes to apply to by the **start of July** (5 months before).

# Things you should do 

There's a lot of things you should do.

1.  **Decide where you want to apply**
    1.  Make a long list of schools + programmes to apply to, and take note of their deadlines
    2.  Whittle down that long list to a shortlist - the final number depends on how many you think you could practically apply for. I applied to 9 schools.
2.  Email potential recommenders to request for **letters of recommendation**
3.  Contact professors you're interested in working with (optional)
4.  Write the **Statement of Purpose** for each school (take 2 weeks to write your first statement, then an additional 1 week to edit it for each additional school)
5.  Write a **Personal Statement, Diversity Statement** for each school (if applicable)
6.  **Follow up** with your recommenders for their LORs
7.  **Edit** your statements and have someone else review them
8.  **Fill in the application forms** and check that all information is correct
9.  Submit!

Because the deadline for my first grad school application was Nov 21, my application timeline looked roughly like this:

| Date     | Task                                                                                                |

# Deciding where to apply 

## Figure out your research interests

At the start of my search, I found it useful to distill what exactly my research interests are. This will also help you write your SOP later on.

-   Can you describe your research interests in one sentence?

-   What are some key words you would use to describe your research interests?

For example, in my case, I was broadly interested in creating synthetic biology tools and applying them solve issues in sustainability, so I looked into labs with related goals. I tried to be as open-minded as possible and also long-listed labs that were vaguely related work even if it wasn't directly related to my research interests.

## Searching for labs 

Once I had defined my research goals, these were the things I did to find labs:

-   Ask experienced scientists in the field for lab recommendations (I just asked my PI)

-   Enter my research interests into Google

-   Look into the institutions of authors who wrote papers that I liked

-   If I found a lab that I liked, I would look into all the programmes that lab was associated with and check the descriptions of all the other labs in that programme

During my search, I noticed that the labs I was interested in working with were actually scattered across different programmes and departments. For example, in my case, synthetic biology labs were typically found across biology, chemistry, biological engineering, chemical engineering, and microbiology programmes. So have a look at the schools' list of PhD programmes to get a full list of what programmes they offer. Often, a professor may be associated with multiple programmes in a school, which gives you the flexibility to apply to the programme which your profile matches the best with.

To keep track of all the information during the search process, I made a spreadsheet that listed the labs I was interested in, along with a short description of their research, and a link to the lab website.

## Narrowing down the field 

After I made my long list, I narrowed down the list of programmes to just 9, and also identified 3 labs in each programme that I could write about in my statement of purpose (more later on). To decide which programmes to apply to, I used the following criteria:

1.  Number of professors in the programme whose research I was interested in: I only wanted to apply to programmes where there were at least **3 professors** whom I could see myself working with. I decided on 3 because that is the typical number of rotations you get in a PhD programme. I reasoned that the more labs I was interested in, the more likely the programme was a good fit for my research interests.
2.  Lab diversity: Particularly, I looked for **diversity** in the membership of the lab. Is there a good mix of PhD students to postdocs? A mix of American and international students? A mix of people of different genders, ethnicities, ages? In my past experience, I felt that diverse labs had more welcoming and inclusive environments. There were actually a few labs whose research I was interested in, but decided against applying to because their membership was too homogenous.
3.  City environment: Since a PhD will take 5-7 years to complete, I wanted to do it in a city I'd be comfortable living in. So things like cost of living, weather, activities, food, etc. came into consideration.

Some other factors you might want to consider, but I didn't really prioritize, were: lab size, school environment, school ranking, how famous the professor is... In my opinion, school ranking (e.g. QS) is irrelevant to the quality of the programme because it's too subfield-dependent.

# Requesting for letters of recommendation 

## Who to ask

You need three recommenders. You should ask people who are familiar with your work as a researcher, so ideally past PIs. However, if you haven't had at least three PIs, you can also ask other academic staff who have taught you and know you personally.

## How to ask 

Because a letter of recommendation takes a while to write, and PIs are very busy people, you should ask them as early as possible, and also remind them again about the letter closer to the deadline.

To make the process as convenient for your recommenders as possible, send them two things:

-   A spreadsheet with the list of programmes and their deadlines, so that they can keep track of it more easily.

-   A short summary of what you did in the lab (especially if you worked in their lab a long time ago)

## Following up

Send a reminder about 1 month, and then 1 week before the deadline.

Sometimes cases can occur where your recommender does not submit the letter by the deadline. However, if this happens, do not panic! If the rest of your application is complete apart from the LOR, programmes will not typically reject your application right away - there is an understanding that PIs are busy and may not meet the deadline. Just email the programme right away to let them know about the situation, and email your recommender to remind them about the deadline. This situation happened to me with one of my recommenders and it turned out fine.

Once everything has been submitted, definitely send a thank you email to your recommenders, and update them on how your application turned out.

# Contacting professors you're interested in working with

This is an optional task, but I emailed a bunch of professors that I was particularly interested in working with to introduce myself, and also to ask whether a) they are taking in new PhD students, and b) whether they had any projects for PhD students to work on. My emails usually went something like this:

> Subject: Inquiry from prospective PhD applicant
>
> Dear Prof XXX,
>
> My name is YYY, and I am a recent \<insert major\> graduate from \<college name\>. I am now working as a research assistant in the lab of Dr AAA. My current research focuses on XYZ. I am planning to apply to the Bioengineering PhD programme at \<school you're applying to\> this year.
>
> I recently read about your lab’s work on \<insert lab's research topic\>, and became interested in the research your lab is currently doing. I was wondering whether you might be taking in new PhD students in Fall 2024, and if so, what kinds of projects a PhD student in your lab could get involved in. I would be appreciative as well of any other information or advice you have. 
>
> I have also attached my CV to provide more information about my research background. 
>
> Thank you! 
>
> Best regards, 

There is some disagreement over whether this actually matters for admissions or not. I'm not actually sure if it does, but it can't hurt. In any case, it's definitely important to check whether a professor is admitting new PhD students - I only found out this way that some of the profs were actually not taking new students, so it saved me the time of applying to their lab/programme. Some profs even replied with useful advice for the application (e.g. which programme would be better to apply to if I wanted to work with them).

# Writing the statement of purpose

This is probably the most tedious part of the application process. There are lots of existing resources online that are probably still relevant, so I will just link them here and leave you to refer to them.

However, I will point out a couple of things I found important:

-   The SOP is meant to showcase

# Writing the personal statement and diversity statement
